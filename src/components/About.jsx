      Hi there! I'm an agricultural engineer who has recently discovered my
      passion for web programming. Although my background and work experience
      are in agriculture, I have been training and practicing web development on
      both the front-end and back-end. I am excited to continue learning and
      developing my skills in web programming, and I hope to apply my knowledge
      to projects that have an attractive design and easy-to-use.
    </p>
